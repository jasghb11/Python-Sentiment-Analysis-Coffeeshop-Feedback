This Python project allows you to use two different pre-trained sentiment analysis models to read a csv file and determine the positive or negative
sentiment of text. This can be useful in quickly understanding whether a given text is conveying positive, neutral, or negative 
emotions from the writer. The applications for such models are obvious for many business contexts. In this case, the two models
are used to determine the sentiment of user reviews for a coffeeshop. 

Getting started with this project, you'll need a few Python staples such as:
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and nltk. 
These can all be pip installed and imported prior to starting. 

Additionally, you will need to download the vaders and roberta sentiment analysis models. 
Finally, the specific roberta model is cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment. (this model will be explictly called out in 
the source code as well)

First Steps
Import the necessary Python files and determining the shape of the expected dataframe.

Next we will use the vader model to showcase tokenization and how it helps us understand the sentiment of the user reviews.
We will then create tables to plot how the vader model is interpreting our data. 
The final section of code will introduce the roberta model, contrast how its scores differ from the vader model
(if at all). The code finishes with a quick data visualization showing how the two models scores correlate to each other.
